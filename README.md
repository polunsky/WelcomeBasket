#ATXHack4Change proposal to help new residents be good neighbors
Goal: new residents get a welcome letter from the Mayor or appropriate elected official telling them where to access needed services, the neighborhood association, and such. 
Looking for anyone who knows where the needed databases are as well as suggestions and of course anyone who can help put code together to do it. Especially need ideas on databases that list new residents. Possible services to highlight include nearest grocery store, restaurant that passed health inspection, bus stop, public library with wifi. Travel time to downtown calculator? Other ideas? 
When you were a new resident, what were the first things you went looking for? 
The concept is online at https://github.com/atxhack4change/2016-project-proposals/issues/20 .
